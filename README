This is a C rewrite based on El Samuko's (elsamuko@gmail.com - 2009) FLTK BOIDS.
https://sites.google.com/site/elsamuko/c-cpp/boids

The program has been ported to S.Ha.R.K Realtime kernel (http://shark.sssup.it/)
Authors: Alessandro Rosetti and Daniele Lazzarini.
Every fish status was updated by a dedicated process.
(that's why there is a lot of mutex code :P).

The S.Ha.R.K port has been _re_ported_ to Linux using SDL by:
Alessandro Rosetti.

The code could be in "Dragon's Ahead" mode because of some S.Ha.R.K kernel's
limitations.
